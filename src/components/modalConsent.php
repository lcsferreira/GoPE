        This project is being conducted by a team of Physical Education, physical activity and public
        health experts from the Global Observatory for Physical Education – GoPE!, coordinated by
        João Martins (Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal).
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to assess the current status and trends of Physical Education
        surveillance, policy and research indicators worldwide, using the data collected by the GoPE!.
        This project will collaborate with a team of top-level Physical Education researchers,
        epidemiologists, public health and education policymakers, practitioners, and experts worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no potential risks of participating in this project. If you agree to take part, you will
        review, complete, and approve the data for each of the indicators we will include in the Physical
        Education profiles called the Country Cards. These indicators include: country demographics,
        physical activity prevalence in adolescents, Physical Education policy, Physical Education
        surveillance, and Physical Education and school-based physical activity interventions research.
        There are no personal benefits from engaging in this project. We will use the results from this
        study to produce Physical Education profiles for your country. There are no costs associated
        with taking part in this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you agree to participate, you will engage for one month to review and approve data.
        Reviewing the Country Cards will extend for one year, followed by another year for manuscript
        analysis. Voluntary participation aligns with ongoing GoPE! monitoring, with Country Card
        updates every 4-5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, an Almanac will be developed consolidating all Country Cards into a single
        publication. Additionally, your country, you, and GoPE! will be the owners of the Country Card.
        Your name and affiliation as the GoPE! Country Contact will be included on the Country Cards,
        Almanac, manuscripts, and the GoPE! Observatory’s website.

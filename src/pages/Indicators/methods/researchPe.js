    html: "<p>In this dimension related to the country’s research capacity in Physical Education and school-based interventions to promote physical activity in children and adolescents, two major phases allowed us to identify the number of studies conducted in each country.</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Umbrella systematic review</strong></p><p>In the first phase, a systematic umbrella review of Physical Education and school-based physical activity intervention and intervention-related studies for promoting physical activity in children and adolescents was conducted to collect data for the research indicators of this dimension. The development is described in: Martins, J., Ramirez, A., Costa, J., Onofre, M., Cristão, R., Dudley, D., Pratt, M., Tassitano, R., Halal, P. (2023). Worldwide physical education and school-based physical activity interventions for promoting physical activity in children and adolescents: A protocol for a systematic umbrella review. DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/D2XWE</p><p>The outcome of this phase is identifying the intervention and intervention-related studies conducted per country (presented in a table for your confirmation).</p><p>An intervention study is a type of study in which an intervention is applied to a group of people in a specific context (school) to verify its impact on an outcome of interest (namely physical activity).</p><p>Physical activity: is any form of bodily movement performed by skeletal muscles that results in an increase in energy expenditure. Examples of common types of activity are walking, cycling, running, dancing, swimming, yoga, and gardening (WHO, 2022).</p><p>For the GoPE!, in the intervention and intervention-related studies that you may provide, the PA outcome can be presented in many different ways, such as: duration of PA, frequency of PA, intensity of PA (light, moderate-to-vigorous, vigorous), meeting the PA guidelines, number of steps, active travel, etc.). Within the school context, you may consider diverse contexts where PA can be promoted, such as Physical education, active classes, active travel to and from school, active recess, and extra-curricular PA.</p><p><strong>Phase 2: GoPE! Country Contact adds intervention studies</strong></p><p>The GoPE country contact analysed the outcome table of the umbrella systematic review and suggested other intervention studies that met the following inclusion criteria:</p><p><strong>Population</strong> – Children (5-10 years of age) and/or adolescents (11-17 years of age) attending school. For different age limits, the mean age provided needs to fall within these gaps.</p><p><strong>Intervention</strong> – Physical Education and school-based interventions to promote physical activity among children and/or adolescents.</p><p><strong>Comparator</strong> - Any comparison group</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> – Physical activity as the main/primary outcome (e.g. moderate to vigorous physical activity, meeting the physical activity recommendations, number of steps, active travel, etc)</p><p><strong>Study type</strong> – Intervention studies and any other study design if the study is related to a school-based intervention (e.g. longitudinal, qualitative; …) to promote physical activity. We want you to report an intervention study (e.g. RCT, quasi-experimental, …). An intervention study is a type of study in which an intervention is applied to a group of people in a specific context to verify its impact on an outcome of interest (physical activity). You can also report intervention-related studies with a different design (e.g. longitudinal studies, cohort studies).</p><p><strong>Setting</strong> – School as the primary focus</p><p><strong>Other</strong> – Articles published in peer reviewed journals with an abstract in English, empirical studies.</p><p style='    padding-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid; border-color: var(--gray-light);'><strong>Exclusion criteria</strong> – We don’t want studies that:</p><p><strong>Population</strong> - Unschooled children and adolescents; adults; children aged less than 5 years</p><p><strong>Intervention</strong> - Interventions not focusing mainly on physical activity promotion</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> – Physical activity is not an outcome or is not the main outcome</p><p><strong>Study type</strong> – Not a school-based intervention to promote PA study nor a study related to an intervention; reviews; protocols.</p><p><strong>Setting</strong> – School is not the main setting of the intervention</p><p><strong>Other</strong> – Grey literature, dissertations, studies published in journals without peer reviews, conceptual papers.</p><p style='padding-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid; border-color: var(--gray-light);'>The umbrella review (phase 1) and the contribution of the GoPE! Country Contact suggestions (phase 2) will allow, at least, the following four indicators to be computed.</p><p><strong>01. Total number of articles published in the country</strong></p><p>The total number of articles published in the country related to Physical Education and school-based physical activity interventions for children and adolescents.</p><p><strong>02. Position in the ranking</strong></p><p>Given the total number of articles published per country, each country will be assigned a position in the ranking (position 1 will represent the country with the most articles published).</p><p><strong>03. Country contribution to Physical Education and school-based physical activity interventions research worldwide</strong></p><p>The country’s contribution to worldwide Physical Education and school-based physical activity interventions research will be estimated as the percentage of publications per country (total articles per country / total of articles worldwide) * 100.</p><p><strong>04. Research articles quintiles</strong></p><p>Research articles quintiles will be calculated to display a comparison between countries on the country cards. The quintiles will be labelled 1-low; 2-lower-middle; 3-middle; 4-upper-middle; and, 5-high.</p>",
